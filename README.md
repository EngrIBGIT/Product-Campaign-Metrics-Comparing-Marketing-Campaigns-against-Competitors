## Data Exploration and Cleaning:
We use unique Identifiers to check for the following:
- Customer_table: Ensuring no duplicate found in data, No missing values, Understand the number of rows
- Market_Campaign: 
- External factors: No duplicates, has unique dates with columns rows
- Competitor Campaign: No duplicates, Has 9 columns

## Data Blending: Merging and joining the datasets
Competitor campaign and Market campaign data: Datasets may not directly connect because Competitor camp and Market camp data may not connect however can be compared based on similar Adspend, conversion, Impressions, clicks and sales, and start date.
To check key indicators; compare and contrast how they are doing against each other

Marketing campaigns and external factors through the data field, connection help understand the impact of external factors on GDP growth rate, and inflation rate, with this connection, the following 
Can be performed:
Only Blend is Marketing Campaign and Customers: Providing insights into cust. Demographics and performance; Using inner joins, returning matching rows from both tables

![](datacl_ExtF.PNG)

## Customer Base Analysis: 
To understand how customer base  interact with products, how different segments at different locations perform base on the different fields
The location distribution of customers by sales, Gender Distribution of customer by sales, Age Distribution of Customers by sales, Customer segment by sales

 To measure/quantify how GDP, inflation, Customer sentiment index is at certain time period;
 
![](https://github.com/EngrIBGIT/Product-Campaign-Metrics-Comparing-Marketing-Campaigns-against-Competitors/blob/main/External%20Factors%20Corralation.PNG)

### Observations:

Examining the external factors, there seems to be influences on the performance as seen in the GDP, the inflation rate, and the customer sentiment index. 

The inflation rate has a weak correlation with the sales, and ROI, indicating influence due to changes in consumer spending behavior during different inflator periods.

Consumer segment index exhibits a weak correlation with the campaign segment i.e. sales and ROI, possibly customer segments have some impact on how customers interact with product
